  Sailing Co-Operatives are organizations dedicated to reducing the
  cost and barriers to entry in sailboat ownership. By joining a co-op,
  you gain access to one or more boats as well as a group of like-minded
  sailors who share your enthusiasm for adventure.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-extrabold mb-5">Sailing is Freedom</h2>

<p class="text-lg">These days, life is busy. Hectic. And it can sometimes feel like a cage.</p>

<p class="text-md">Sailing gives you the opportunity to break free from the daily struggle by getting you out into nature and palling around with friends. But sailing has some high barriers to entry: Cost is the main one, and then there's maintenance, training, and experience.</p>

<p class="text-md">Co-operatives ease these hurdles by allowing groups of people to pool their resources and share boats as they gain experience with sailing and exposure to the day-to-day realities of boat ownership. Usually these organizations are non-profits and rely on membership dues and "Sweat Equity" to maintain their fleet.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Journal Units</h3>
        <p style="min-height: 70px;">Divvy up the workday into a manageable schedule.</p>
        <ul class="ml-4">
            <li>Journal Unit: <em>2 Pomodoros + rest time</em></li>
            <li>65 minutes</li>
            <li>4 to 5 Journal Units in a day</li>
            <li>At the end of each unit, write a short summary of what you did</li>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Pomodoro-Compatible</h3>
        <p style="min-height: 70px;">The well-known Pomodoro technique is useful for tackling a fixed list of tasks.</p>
        <ul class="ml-4">
            <li>1 Pomodoro: <em>25 minutes plus a 5-minute rest</em></li>
            <li>After 2 Pomodoros, a longer 15-minute rest</li>
            <li>Before starting the day, map out a list of your tasks</li>
            <li>Each Pomodoro is for focusing on 1 task</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="md:w-1/3 text-white md:px-2 pt-8 md:pt-0">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">There's An App For That</h3>
        <p style="min-height: 70px;">The app resides in your system tray and pops up at the end of each Journal Unit, prompting you to:</p>
        <ul class="ml-4">
            <li>Type in your Journal Entry directly</li>
            <li>Go for your 15-minute rest</li>
            <li>Start the next Journal Unit when you get back to your computer</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pt-4">Currently it's only available in my brain, so you might say it's a pretty exclusive app.</p>
